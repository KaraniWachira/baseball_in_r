2.  Batting - batting statistics

3.  Pitching - pitching statistics

4.  Fielding - fielding statistics

    A collection of other tables is also provided:

#### Load packages to use

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(caret)
```

View the Lahman package to display the dataset with the data dictionary on the baseball data

```{r}

Teams

View(Teams)

teams <- Teams

head(teams)
```

lets conduct exploratory data analysis

Winning a game in baseball is counted using run, so for our first exploration can we find the average number of runs made in every season in Major league baseball

```{r}

teams_runs <- teams |> 
  mutate(runs_game = R/(W + L))


head(teams_runs)

```

we can narrow down our analysis to find the average number of runs per games for every team for a given year for all teams

```{r}

runs_per_yr <- teams_runs |> 
  group_by(yearID) |> 
  summarize(mean_runs = mean(runs_game, na.rm = TRUE))

head(runs_per_yr)


# lets graph this summary and observe it over time

ggplot(runs_per_yr, aes(x = yearID,  y = mean_runs)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Average MLB Runs by Year",
    caption = "Source: https://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()



```

Ofcos every baseball fan wants his/her team to win. Lets go ahead and create a model to predict wins by team

```{r}

base_df <- teams |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  select(name, yearID, W, L, R, H, X2B, X3B, HR, SO, RA) |> 
  filter(yearID >= 2009)

head(base_df)



```

lets train a linear model based on the variables we filtered above and find out how statistically significant they are.

```{r}

lm1 <- lm(W ~ R + H + X2B + X3B + HR + SO + RA, data = base_df)

summary(lm1)

#observation
# we can observe that tripples(X3B), double(x2b) and strike outs(SO) are not statically significant 
```

we can create another model with only the statistically significant variable and compare

```{r}


lm2 <- lm(W ~ R + H + RA, data = base_df)

summary(lm2)

```

using our second model we can try predicting team wins

```{r}

preds <- predict(lm2, base_df)

#present the predicted value in a column to compare with the actual win value

base_df$pred <- preds 

base_df


# plot the results

base_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = W)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted wins against actual wins",
    x = "Predicted Wins",
    y = "Actual Wins"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
